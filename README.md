# Abstract

Due to the ongoing optimization of harvesting methods in agriculture, the prevention of wild boar damages has become increasingly popular in recent years. Understanding the selection of resting places like nests and wallows build the basis for effective management measures. Based on spatiotemporal data of wild boars we try to determine such resting places and allocate them to surrounding vegetation in ordert to differentiate them further into potential nesting and wallowing areas.

Based on literature data on the behaviour of wild boars and the analysis of movement patterns, we develop a robust method for the identification of potential nests and wallows.

The implementation of the modelling using the software R proves to be well feasible. The main challenges are the definition of clear criteria for the identification of nests and wallows, which the literature only provides to a limited extent, and the validation of the results.
